<h3>6.Subscriptions and Billing</h3>
This Section 6 contains additional provisions that apply if you subscribe to Sofnitech+.

<h4>Sofnitech+ Account Information.</h4>

You can access and edit specific details regarding your subscription to Sofnitech+, including information concerning your credit card or other available payment method (“Payment Method”), on the sofnitech.com website at any time by clicking on your name, which appears at the top of each page of the site when you are logged in, and then following the link to your Sofnitech+ account.

<h4>Age Limitations.</h4>

Individuals under the age of 18 may utilize Sofnitech+ only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian. You acknowledge that by using Sofnitech+, you may be exposed to Content that you find objectionable, and it is your sole responsibility to determine whether the Content in Sofnitech+ is suitable for you. Some Content may not be suitable for people under the age of 18.

<h4>Payment.</h4>

By providing Payment Method information for your Sofnitech+ subscription, you are agreeing to pay a monthly fee, as applicable, and any applicable taxes and service fees (“Fees”) in connection with your use of Sofnitech+. The Fees will be charged to your Payment Method automatically at the beginning of your subscription (or at the end of your Trial Period, where applicable), and at the beginning of each subscription period renewal thereafter on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your subscription unless you cancel your subscription or your account or Sofnitech+ is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms. If your monthly subscription begins after the 28th day of a month, then in any subsequent month in which that day does not occur, Sofnitech will charge your Payment Method on approximately the last day of such month. For example, if you started your monthly subscription on January 31st, your next payment date will be approximately February 28th. The Fees charged to your Payment Method may vary from month to month or year-to-year due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize Sofnitech to charge your Payment Method for these amounts. Sofnitech reserves the right to change the pricing of Sofnitech+ at any time. In the event of a price change, Sofnitech will post the new pricing in Sofnitech+ and attempt to notify you in advance by sending an email to the address you have registered for your account. If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your Sofnitech+ subscription. If there are any discrepancies in billing, you hereby waive your right to dispute such discrepancies if you do not notify Sofnitech within 60 days after they first appear on an account statement. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INTERNET ACCESS CHARGES. PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INTERNET DATA USAGE CHARGES.

<h4>No Refunds.</h4>

ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. Even if you cancel Sofnitech+ during a subscription period, as applicable, you will not receive a refund for any portion of the Fees for the remainder of that period. In rare circumstances, we may provide a credit, refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our subscribers (“Credits”). The amount and form of such Credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole discretion. The provision of Credits in one instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide Credits in the future, under any circumstance.

<h4>Cancellation.</h4>

You can cancel your subscription to Sofnitech+ at any time by contacting us at +263 783 639 225, Sunday to Friday 8am to 6pm CAT, or by logging into your account at https://www.sofnitech.com/sofnitech+/account/ and clicking "cancel subscription." If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of the then-current subscription period, as applicable. You will have continued access to Sofnitech+ for the remainder of your paid subscription period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID. You must cancel your subscription before it renews for the next month or year, as applicable, to avoid paying the Fees for the next month or year, as applicable. After cancellation of your subscription, you will continue to owe any accrued amounts due under these Terms and not yet paid. You acknowledge and agree that cancellation of your subscription is your sole recourse if you have any dissatisfaction, issue or concern related to Sofnitech+, its Content or features or these Terms, including Fees, applicable taxes, or billing methods; the selection of Content available to you through Sofnitech+; these Terms, including the Sofnitech Privacy Policy, or any changes thereto; or any other Sofnitech policies or practices.

<h4>Unpaid Amounts.</h4>

If you fail to pay any Fees when due, as a result of expiration of your Payment Method, insufficient funds, or otherwise, (1) you will remain liable for all such amounts, as well as any costs that Sofnitech incurs in collecting any amounts you fail to pay in connection with Sofnitech+, including attorney and collections fees; (2) you authorize Sofnitech to continue charging your Payment Method, as your Payment Method information may be updated; and (3) we may suspend or terminate your subscription. Changing your Payment Method information may affect the day of your subscription renewal.

<h4>Promo Codes.</h4>

From time to time, promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion. Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion. Promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may not be combined with other offers, subject to certain restrictions as determined by Sofnitech in its sole discretion. If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.

<h4>Trial Period.</h4>

Sofnitech may provide a limited free trial period (“Trial Period”) to new users and certain former subscribers at its sole discretion, but is under no obligation to do so, and Trial Periods may not be available at all times. Sofnitech reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period. The specific terms of the Trial Period will be stated in the marketing material describing the particular Trial Period. If Sofnitech provides you with a Trial Period, you must provide valid Payment Method information to Sofnitech in order to use Sofnitech+ during the Trial Period. Sofnitech will not charge you in connection with the Trial Period. Sofnitech may place a temporary charge in a nominal amount on your Payment Method to ensure the validity of the Payment Method, but the temporary charge will be removed promptly. If you do not cancel Sofnitech+ by the last “day” of your Trial Period, you authorize Sofnitech to begin your paying subscription and automatically charge your Payment Method for your first paying monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable, at the end of your Trial Period. SOFNITECH WILL NOT SEND YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TRIAL PERIOD HAS ENDED OR THAT YOUR PAYING SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN.  IF YOU WISH TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, YOU MUST CANCEL THE TRIAL PERIOD PRIOR TO THE LAST “DAY” OF YOUR TRIAL PERIOD.  A “day” for purposes of these Terms begins at the time you start your subscription (i.e., complete the sign up process), and ends 24 hours later. For example, if you complete your registration at 3:00 p.m. on a Monday in your time zone, and your Trial Period is 2 days, you have until 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday in your time zone to cancel your subscription before your paying subscription will begin. You may only have one Trial Period before you must begin paying for Sofnitech+. If you exceed this limit, Sofnitech may charge your Payment Method for any Trial Period after the first, or suspend your use of Sofnitech+, in its sole discretion.


 

<h4>Updates and Testing.</h4>

Sofnitech reserves the right to update and change Sofnitech+, including its features and the selection of Content available in Sofnitech+, at any time.  In addition, Sofnitech reserves the right to test various aspects of Sofnitech+.

<h4>Sofnitech+ specific Emails.</h4>

As part of Sofnitech+, Sofnitech may send you emails regarding the Content or Sofnitech+ from time to time. You agree that Sofnitech may send you these types of emails to the email address that you provide. Because these emails are necessary for you to receive Sofnitech+, you agree that you will receive these emails even if you have opted out of receiving other email from Sofnitech+. If you do not want to receive these types of emails, you may cancel Sofnitech+ at any time.

<h4>Subscriptions Obtained Through Third Parties.</h4>

If you obtain an Sofnitech+ subscription through a third party distributor that maintains your subscriber account and collects your payments for Sofnitech+, that subscription is subject to the distributor’s terms, and the provisions of this Section concerning subscriptions, billing and payment do not apply to that subscription. When you access Sofnitech+ through a portal provided by such a third-party distributor, and the distributor transmits Sofnitech+ content to you, the provisions of this Section concerning access to and delivery of Sofnitech+ do not necessarily apply, and in the event of a conflict, the distributor’s applicable terms govern.
